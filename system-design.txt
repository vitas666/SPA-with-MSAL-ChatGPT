From now on, I want to add a note in every single project to record how I can design a system to make sure I am following the correct way to write the code.

lab-react-design: the simple way is to demo a login button, when click the button, trigger sso sign in function, open MSAL
1: make a simple button on layout.tsx
2: figure out to add a function to have a MSAL function inside

alternative solution: copy the EIP frontend project and delete the Giant verification, simplily login with personal MSAL
alternative solution: copy microsoft demo code

next stage: try to use the chatbot api on this project
1: after logged in, put a button for user, when onclick, trigger chatbot api
2: when click send, authencate the user
3: if authencate success, call the API of chatbot
4: should get the response after calling the api

Amplience design: 
1: get the url, open the url and get the response by content delivery API(done)
2: get the response json string try to get the image, set up the module in backend(done)
3: using Amplience visualization sdk to render the page

chatbot section: need to find
1: conversation_id (由uuid產生)
2: group_id (由userinfo API取得)
3: model_id (由llms API獲得)
4: API key = 'zv9lMX/Gk2O+gzaw2bAgwctEaAXrpYFS/0znbcIuf3o='
5: chat url = 'https://s-chatbot-adminapi.giantcycling.com'


curl -k -X GET \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer zv9lMX/Gk2O+gzaw2bAgwctEaAXrpYFS/0znbcIuf3o=" \
"https://s-chatbot-adminapi.giantcycling.com/userinfo"

curl -k -X GET \
-H "accept: application/json" \
"$URL/llms?group_id=0718a6a020f64e27b20a5b210e5ca3c0"


TODO: azure的新的任務，去使用azure想辦法呼叫，打chatGPT 4o的API
AWS的之後也去試試
